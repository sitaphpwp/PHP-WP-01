2. Todo Manage 


SRS : System requiremts specification 
======================================

Purpose : manage their tasks and to-do lists.

Scope:
The scope of the project includes user registration,
authentication, 
user profiles, 
and todo management.

User Authentication
===================

User Registration:
==================
Users can register with a unique username and password.
User registration includes providing an email address.
Passwords are securely hashed and stored.
Duplicate usernames and email addresses are not allowed.

Login
=====
Registered users can log in with their username and password.
Authentication is required to access user-specific features.

User Profile
============
Profile Creation
Registered users can create a profile 
with a bio and an optional profile picture (avatar).


Todo Management
===============
4.1 Todo Creation
==================
Authenticated users can create new todo items.
Todo items include a title, description, and optional due date.
Created todo items are associated with the user's account.


4.2 Todo Listing
===================
Users can view a list of their todo items, 
including completed and pending ones.
Todo items can be sorted by due date or creation date.

4.3 Todo Editing and Deletion
============================
Users can edit and update 
the details of their existing todo items.
They can also mark todo items as completed or delete them.



5. Security : 

5.1 Password Security
User passwords are securely hashed and salted.
Proper security measures are implemented to protect user data.


6. User Experience 
6.1 User-Friendly Interface
The application should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy task management.

7. Database

7.1 Database Design
The database design should follow the specified structure for 
users, user profiles, and todo items.

8. Platform 
1. Server side : PHP 
2. Database : Mysql 
3. Frontend : HTML CSS JS Tailwind Bootstrap
4. API N/A

9. Coding (Programming) / implementation 
	
10. Testing 

11. Deployment
11.1 Hosting
The application should be hosted on a secure web server.
11.2 : Cloud / AWS / Azura  

10. Maintenance and Support : 


SDLC : Software Development Life Cycle 

1. Water Fall 

The sequential phases in Waterfall model are −

Requirement Gathering and analysis − All possible requirements of the system to be developed are captured in this phase and documented in a requirement specification document.

System Design − The requirement specifications from first phase are studied in this phase and the system design is prepared. This system design helps in specifying hardware and system requirements and helps in defining the overall system architecture.

Implementation − With inputs from the system design, the system is first developed in small programs called units, which are integrated in the next phase. Each unit is developed and tested for its functionality, which is referred to as Unit Testing.

Integration and Testing − All the units developed in the implementation phase are integrated into a system after testing of each unit. Post integration the entire system is tested for any faults and failures.

Deployment of system − Once the functional and non-functional testing is done; the product is deployed in the customer environment or released into the market.

Maintenance − There are some issues which come up in the client environment. To fix those issues, patches are released. Also to enhance the product some better versions are released. Maintenance is done to deliver these changes in the customer environment.

## Database Design:
Users Table:
User Profiles Table:
Todo Items Table:


## Users Table:
user_id (Primary Key)
username (Unique, for authentication)
password (Hashed and salted password)
email (Unique, for user identification and communication)
full_name (User's full name)
created_at (Timestamp of user registration)

## User Profiles Table:

profile_id (Primary Key)
user_id (Foreign Key linked to Users table)
bio (Short user bio or description)
avatar (Link to user's profile picture)
created_at (Timestamp of profile creation)

## Todo Items Table:

todo_id (Primary Key)
user_id (Foreign Key linked to Users table)
title (Title of the todo item)
description (Detailed description of the todo item)
due_date (Due date for the todo item)
completed (Boolean to track whether the todo item is completed or not)
created_at (Timestamp of todo item creation)

Relationship : 

user has one profile  (one to one)
user has many todos   (one to many)
