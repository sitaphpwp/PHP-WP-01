# Conditional Statments (Topics)

1.  if else
2.  if elseif else with nested block
3.  Switch Cases
4.  Alternative way uses

# Conditional structures allow you to make decisions in your code based on certain conditions. Here's a simple example involving an if statement:

# Real-Life Example: Checking Age Eligibility

Suppose you're building a website that sells tickets for an event, and
you want to check if a person is eligible for a discounted ticket based
on their age.

# Example :

\$age = 28; // You can change the age to see different outcomes

build this using your own logics.

\$age = 28; // You can change the age to see different outcomes

if
($age < 18) {  echo "You are eligible for a child ticket."; } elseif ($age
\>= 18 && \$age \< 65) { echo "You are eligible for a regular ticket.";
} else { echo "You are eligible for a senior ticket."; }

# nested if else

In this scenario, let's consider a grading system for a school, where
the grading is based on both the numerical score and the attendance of a
student.

\$score = 75; // Numerical score (out of 100) \$attendance = 80; //
Attendance percentage

```{=html}
<!--  lets build your own logic  -->
```
if ($attendance >= 90) {  if ($score \>= 90) { echo "Excellent! You've
earned an A."; } elseif (\$score \>= 80) { echo "Great job! You've
earned a B."; } else { echo "Good job! You've earned a C."; } }
elseif(condition){

}

else{ echo "Your attendance is low. Please improve."; }

# switch case

\$dayOfWeek = 3; // Change the value to see different outcomes

switch (\$dayOfWeek) { case 1: echo "It's Monday."; break; default: echo
"Invalid day of the week."; break; }

# Branching Statment / looping

1.  for Loop :

A for loop is used to execute a block of code a specified number of
times.

for (\$i = 1; \$i \<= 5; \$i++) { echo "Iteration: \$i`<br>`{=html}"; }

This example will output the numbers from 1 to 5 along with the
iteration number.

2.  while Loop: A while loop continues executing a block of code as long
    as a certain condition is true.

$count = 1; while ($count \<= 3) { echo "Count: \$count`<br>`{=html}";
\$count++; } This example will output the numbers from 1 to 3 using a
while loop.

3.  do-while Loop

A do-while loop is similar to a while loop, but it executes the code
block at least once before checking the condition.

\$counter = 1; do { echo "Value: \$counter`<br>`{=html}";
$counter++; } while ($counter \<= 2);

This example will output the value once and then stop because the
condition is not met.

4.  foreach Loop:

A foreach loop is used to iterate over each element in an array.

$fruits = array("Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Mango"); foreach ($fruits
as \$fruit) { echo "Fruit: \$fruit`<br>`{=html}"; }

# A real-life example

a real-life example where you want to print a countdown message for a
special event. You can use a for loop to count down from a specified
number to 1.

\$daysUntilEvent = 5;

echo "Countdown to the Special Event:`<br>`{=html}";

for (\$i = \$daysUntilEvent; \$i \>= 1; $i--) {  if ($i == 1) { echo
"Only 1 day left!`<br>`{=html}"; } else { echo "\$i days
left!`<br>`{=html}"; } }

# Array

In PHP, an array is a data structure that allows you to store multiple
values of the same or different data types under a single variable name.
Arrays provide a way to organize and manage collections of data
efficiently. Each value in an array is called an element, and each
element has a unique index or key that identifies its position within
the array.

There are several types of arrays in PHP:

1.  Indexed Arrays: These are arrays where elements are assigned numeric
    indices starting from 0.

\$fruits = array("Apple", "Banana", "Orange"); echo \$fruits\[0\]; //
Outputs: Apple

2.  Associative Arrays: In associative arrays, elements are assigned a
    named key or index instead of numeric indices.

\$person = array("name" =\> "John", "age" =\> 30, "occupation" =\>
"Engineer"); echo \$person\["name"\]; // Outputs: John

3.  Multidimensional Arrays: These are arrays that contain other arrays
    as elements. They can be used to represent more complex data
    structures.

# Imagine we're building a simple contacts application. You want to store information about people, including their names, phone numbers, and email addresses

// Creating an associative array to store contact information \$contact1
= array( "name" =\> "John Doe", "phone" =\> "123-456-7890", "email" =\>
"john@example.com" );

\$contact2 = array( "name" =\> "Jane Smith", "phone" =\> "987-654-3210",
"email" =\> "jane@example.com" );

\$contact3 = array( "name" =\> "Robert Johnson", "phone" =\>
"555-123-4567", "email" =\> "robert@example.com" );

// Storing the contacts in an array $contacts = array($contact1,
\$contact2, \$contact3);

// Accessing and printing contact information foreach (\$contacts as
\$contact) { echo "Name:" . \$contact\["name"\] . "`<br>`{=html}"; echo
"Phone:" . \$contact\["phone"\] . "`<br>`{=html}"; echo "Email:" .
\$contact\["email"\] . "`<br>`{=html}`<br>`{=html}"; }

# String to Array Example:

// Storing the order as a string with comma delimiter \$orderString =
"T-shirt,Jeans,Sneakers";

// Converting the order string into an array using comma as the
delimiter \$orderArray = explode(",", \$orderString);

// Displaying the individual items in the order foreach (\$orderArray as
\$item) { echo "Item:" . \$item . "`<br>`{=html}"; }

# Array to String Example:

// Array containing the ordered items \$confirmedItems =
array("T-shirt", "Jeans", "Sneakers");

// Converting the array of items into a string with comma delimiter
\$confirmedItemsString = implode(",", \$confirmedItems);

// Composing the confirmation email \$confirmationEmail = "Thank you for
your order! You have purchased:" . \$confirmedItemsString;

// Sending the confirmation email echo \$confirmationEmail;

# Associtive array to string conversation serilize and json

1.  Serialization: Serialization is the process of converting a data
    structure, such as an array, into a format that can be easily stored
    or transmitted and later reconstructed.

// Associative array \$data = array( "name" =\> "John Doe", "age" =\>
25, "email" =\> "john@example.com" );

// Serialize the array $serializedData = serialize($data);

// Display the serialized data echo \$serializedData;

The output of echo \$serializedData; would look something like:

a:3:{s:4:"name";s:8:"John
Doe";s:3:"age";i:25;s:5:"email";s:16:"john@example.com";}

To deserialize (unserialize) the data back into an array, you would use
the unserialize() function:

// Deserialize the data
$unserializedData = unserialize($serializedData);

// Display the unserialized data print_r(\$unserializedData);

2.  JSON Encoding:

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange
format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines
to parse and generate

Here's how you can encode an associative array as a JSON string:

// Associative array \$data = array( "name" =\> "John Doe", "age" =\>
25, "email" =\> "john@example.com" );

// Encode the array as JSON $jsonData = json_encode($data);

// Display the JSON data echo \$jsonData;

The JSON-encoded output would look like:

{"name":"John Doe","age":25,"email":"john@example.com"}

To decode the JSON string back into an associative array, you would use
the json_decode() function:

// Decode the JSON data $decodedData = json_decode($jsonData, true);

// Display the decoded data print_r(\$decodedData);
